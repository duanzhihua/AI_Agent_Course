# Silicon Valley Controllable AI Agent Course Website

This is a single-page HTML website based on the content from the provided URL.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop.
- **Dark Mode UI**: Professional "Tech/Cyberpunk" aesthetic suitable for AI technology.
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses CDN for icons, but the core layout is pure HTML/CSS.

## How to Use
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Content Source
Based on "硅谷可控大模型智能体AI技术" (Silicon Valley Controllable LLM Agent AI Technology).
**Core Philosophy**: Control is enforced at runtime, not assumed at training time.

## Note on Images
Since direct image extraction from the source URL requires browser access, I have used **FontAwesome** icons and CSS gradients to maintain a high-quality, professional look without broken image links. You can easily replace the icons with actual screenshots or photos in the `index.html` file if desired.
